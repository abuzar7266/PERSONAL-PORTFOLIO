      knowledge.My motivation behind ML & DL and different related fields that works with Artificial Itelligence is because I am craving to get knowledge about how to create knowledge and how to create things that can gain knowledge on basis of 
      what they do So i wish to be a good Machine learning expert but i also expect myself to become good at other fields in Computer science Just to settle down myself in hobbies`
